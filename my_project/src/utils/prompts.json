        "general_response": " A. When someone is being bullied, they may react in a variety of ways. Many people choose silence and isolation, feeling ashamed or afraid to share their experience. They may display intense emotions such as sadness, anxiety or frustration, which manifests itself in mood swings or crying. Some may defend themselves verbally or physically, which can escalate the conflict. Bullying can also affect their academic or work performance, as concentration and motivation decrease. In addition, physical symptoms such as headaches or sleep problems may appear. While some people seek support from friends or family, others develop resilience and coping strategies to deal with the situation. Each reaction is unique and reflects the complexity of the bullying experience.",
        "profiles": {
            "autonomous": "Considering your autonomous profile, you could try to deal with the situation yourself, perhaps through communication and trying to defend yourself so that the aggression stops. It may be a good first reaction to establish the limit that you do not agree with that behavior and also mention a consequence in case it happens again, such as asking for help from someone with more authority. If the behavior is repetitive, it is important that the authority supports you and that you seek support from your social network so as not to allow the aggression to affect you psychologically or expose you to physical aggression.",

However, this reaction is not sustainable over time, either directly or indirectly, frequent abuse can begin to affect the way you feel about yourself and destabilize you to the point where you feel you can't take it anymore. Staying out of the way is a reaction just as valid as confronting someone if it makes you feel safer, but you can do it without showing any kind of approval of the inappropriate behavior. Keeping silent, not supporting them, or showing discontent with their attitude takes power away from the person who is abusing them and supports the person who is being abused.",
            "isolative": "Given your isolationist profile, they could simply try to get away from you as soon as possible or seek refuge in some distraction to ignore the conflict. However, this reaction allows the behavior to be normalized and perpetuated and, due to isolation, you become a more likely target because loneliness is a power mechanism for the person who is aggressing. Knowing that you are not going to betray them or react gives them confidence to continue the abuse. Therefore, you can try to activate attention routes anonymously or secretly but directly to someone who you know can intervene in the situation.",
            "impulsive": "Given your impulsive profile, you could encourage some kind of direct confrontation or a way to intimidate and compensate for the aggressor's action. Although it is a reaction that can be both instinctive and logical, it can lead to the escalation of violence and trap you in a dynamic that affects you in the long term. Despite the provocation, a reaction different from what the aggressor expects can be more destabilizing, such as indifference or the search for help, which sends a direct signal that this type of behavior is not tolerable and will not be duplicated under any circumstances."

        "general_response": "A. Not knowing what to do when faced with a problem is a fairly common reaction for most people regardless of any condition and can be influenced by different variables, such as: Emotional overload: When we face a problem, emotions can cloud our judgment, making us feel overwhelmed and making it difficult to make decisions. Lack of information: Sometimes, we don't have all the information necessary to address a problem, which creates uncertainty about how to act. Fear of failure: The fear of making mistakes or of the solution not working can paralyze us, making us doubt our decisions. Overanalysis: Thinking too much about options can lead to analysis paralysis, where you get stuck in indecision. Lack of experience: If it's your first time facing a type of problem, it can be difficult to know where to start. High expectations: The pressure to find the “perfect solution” can cause us to avoid making decisions.

Gratitude Practice: Every day, write down three things you are grateful for. This will help you focus your mind on the positive, even in difficult times. Cognitive Reframing: Try to see the problem from a different perspective. Ask yourself what lessons you can learn or what opportunities can arise from the situation.
